# Sublime Text 2 KeepOpen plugin

This plugin resembles the behaviour often requested by Firefox and Chrome users (including me) to keep the browser open when closing the last tab, by opening a new home tab.

Works best with the `"close_windows_when_empty": true` setting. Unfortunately this has no effect when last tab is dragged from a window and i will target this issue in future version of this plugin.
